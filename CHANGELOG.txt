Support for Mixpanel push notifications

    The Mixpanel library now handles registering for and receiving
    Google Cloud Messaging notifications sent from the Mixpanel interface.

    for instructions on getting started using Mixpanel to
    engage directly with users of your application.

    To build the core library, type 'ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android/sdk ant library'
    at your command line.
